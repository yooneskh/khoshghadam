      The Snowball Effect: How Small Savings Can Create Wealth
    </h1>

    <div class="px-3 my-3">
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Imagine you're standing at the top of a snowy mountain, holding a single snowball. You give it a gentle push, and as it rolls downhill, it starts picking up more snow, growing larger and faster with each turn. What started as a tiny ball becomes an unstoppable force.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This is exactly how compound interest works in your finances. It's not magic—it's mathematics. But the results can feel magical when you understand how it transforms ordinary savings into extraordinary wealth.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Albert Einstein famously called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it. Let's explore this powerful concept together, starting with a story that might sound familiar.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Meet Sarah and Mike. Both are 25 years old and decide to start saving for retirement. Sarah starts putting away $200 per month into a savings account earning 6% interest. Mike waits 10 years, then starts saving the same $200 per month at the same 6% rate.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        After 30 years, Sarah has saved $72,000 of her own money but has earned $145,000 in compound interest—for a total of $217,000. Mike has saved $72,000 of his own money too, but only earned $72,000 in interest—for a total of $144,000.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">
        By starting just 10 years earlier, Sarah ends up with 50% more money—without saving a single extra dollar!

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Understanding the Two Types of Interest</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Now that you've seen the power of compounding in action, let's break down the fundamental difference between simple and compound interest. Think of it like this:
      </p>

      <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Simple Interest: The Straight Line</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Simple interest is like walking on a flat road. You earn interest only on your original investment amount. If you deposit $1,000 at 5% simple interest, you earn $50 every year—no more, no less. After 3 years, you've earned $150 total, for a final amount of $1,150.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
          <em>Formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time</em>

      <div class="mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Compound Interest: The Snowball Effect</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Compound interest is like rolling that snowball down a hill. Each year, you earn interest on your original money <em>plus</em> all the interest you've already earned. Your money doesn't just grow—it accelerates!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          With the same $1,000 at 5% compounded annually, you earn $50 in the first year ($1,000 × 0.05). But in year two, you earn interest on $1,050, so you get $52.50. Year three: $1,102.50 × 0.05 = $55.13. After 3 years, you have $1,157.63—more than with simple interest!
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
          <em>This is where the magic happens: interest earning interest.</em>
